# [Nvidia] DXR "HelloTriangle" - Refitting without helpers
This is the Raytracing triangles of Tutorial 5, made from Nvidia DXR Tutorials, this time without helper classes. So you can see the creation of every object used.

This is a tutorial made by Nvidia, that you can find here: [NVIDIAGameWorks/DxrTutorials](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/DxrTutorials).

The project structure is copied from [Jorgemagic/CSharpDirectXRaytracing](https://github.com/Jorgemagic/CSharpDirectXRaytracing) because i found it quite clean and easy to read.

## Points of interest
See the [Important Concepts](CONCEPTS.md) document, that you can find in this folder.
