# [Nvidia] DXR "HelloTriangle" - Refitting without helpers
This is the Raytracing triangles of Tutorial 5, made from Nvidia DXR Tutorials, this time without helper classes. So you can see the creation of every object used.

**Note** that the code of this tutorial is **quite different** from tutorial 1-5 because comes from a different source, so even if the topics are the same the structure of the code is a bit different. This structure might be used for future tutorials.

This is a tutorial made by Nvidia, that you can find here: [NVIDIAGameWorks/DxrTutorials](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/DxrTutorials).

The project structure is copied from [Jorgemagic/CSharpDirectXRaytracing](https://github.com/Jorgemagic/CSharpDirectXRaytracing) because i found it quite clean and easy to read.
