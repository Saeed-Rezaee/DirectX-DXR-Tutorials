# Lighting Rendering  - Important Concepts
This document is a small list of important concepts, in order to focus attention on some parts and functions in the code. Take the whole example as a reference.

Thanks to [Jorgemagic](https://github.com/Jorgemagic) for his examples.

# Introduction
This document require that you understood the basic Raytracing flow made in [Tutorial 7](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/tree/master/07-Primitives), so you know how the primitive rendering is done, and can add a basic lighting to it.

The project structure is the same from Tutorial 7.

# Preprocessor directives
This project has:
```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
```
defined in the project file, used mostly to use the constant: `M_PI`.

# Acceleration Structures / RT Pipeline
One small difference in the Acceleration Structures files, is that the created primitive is now a static pointer: [AccelerationStructures.h#L34](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/blob/master/08-Lighting/Project/Source/Utils/AccelerationStructures.h#L34), this to access its index/vertex buffer directly: [D3D12Lighting.cpp#L457](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/blob/master/08-Lighting/Project/Source/D3D12Lighting.cpp#L457).

The RTPipeline has now a specific Hit descriptor: [RTPipeline.cpp#L117](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/blob/master/08-Lighting/Project/Source/Utils/RTPipeline.cpp#L117).

# Main file
The most important and noticeable difference in the main file, is the different `createRtPipelineState`: [D3D12Lighting.cpp#L269](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/blob/master/08-Lighting/Project/Source/D3D12Lighting.cpp#L269) and `createShaderTable`: [D3D12Lighting.cpp#L353](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/blob/master/08-Lighting/Project/Source/D3D12Lighting.cpp#L353).

# Shaders
I have not touched the shader files, they are the same Jorgemagic use in [his example](https://github.com/Jorgemagic/CSharpDirectXRaytracing/tree/master/16-Lighting/Data). If you think they can be improved feel free to contribute: [#Contributions](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials#issues--contributions)!

## Helpers.hlsli
### [(Shader Code)](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/blob/master/08-Lighting/Project/shaders/Helpers.hlsli)

A lot of new variables and function have been added to the Helper file, to calculate the whole Lighting according to camera position, light position, and variables such as the specular power.

## Shaders.hlsl
### [(Shader Code)](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/blob/master/08-Lighting/Project/shaders/Shaders.hlsl)

You can have a look at the new `HitAttribute` function used: [Shaders.hlsl#L58](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/blob/master/08-Lighting/Project/shaders/Shaders.hlsl#L58), and how to closesthit (`chs`) changed: [Shaders.hlsl#L66](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials/blob/master/08-Lighting/Project/shaders/Shaders.hlsl#L66).
