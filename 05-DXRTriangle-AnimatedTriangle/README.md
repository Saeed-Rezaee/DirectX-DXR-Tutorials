# [Nvidia] DXR "HelloTriangle" - Refitting for Animated Scenes
## (Animated Triangles that rotate)
This is the Raytracing triangles of Tutorial 4, with few changes to make the triangles rotate, to show what to change for a moving object.

This is a tutorial made by Nvidia, that you can find here: [Tutorial - Extras - Refitting for Animated Scenes](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/raytracing/dxr/DX12-Raytracing-tutorial/Extra/dxr_tutorial_extra_refit).

Huge thanks to [Martin-Karl Lefran√ßois](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/author/mlefrancois/) and [Pascal Gautron](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/author/pgautron/) that made this tutorial, all this work is theirs.
