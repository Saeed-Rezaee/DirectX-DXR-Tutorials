# DirectX 12 DXR Tutorials
Personal repository of tutorials and examples to understand the basics of DirectX 12 Raytracing (DXR).

## Description
This is a personal repository to study and develop various tutorials about DirectX 12 Raytracing. Right now none of the tutorials is made by me, i just take a tutorial and re-upload it here, cleaning the code from unused functions, writing better includes and comments or stuff like that, making sure the project is still buildable and understandable as much as possible. The source of the tutorial is always in the README of the project directory.

I will also document some parts of the code using Markdown, so that someone who is new in the topic is able to read and understand the basic concepts.

The tutorials are in order of increasing difficulty and complexity.

## Requirements
* Windows 10 with the May 2019 Update;
* Visual Studio 2017 (VS 2019 works updating the building tools to v142 in the project);
* Windows 10 SDK >= May 2019 18362 (10.0.18362.0);
* Dx12 GPU with a compatible DirectX Raytracing driver (Ex: Nvidia driver version 415 or higher).
