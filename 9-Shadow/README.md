# Shadow Rendering
This example shows how to project shadows using Raytracing pipeline. In this example, there is a second geometry (ground) in the Acceleration Structure and we throw a second ray to know whether a hit point is in shadow.

This is an example i found from Jorge Cant√≥n, that you can find here: [Jorgemagic/CSharpDirectXRaytracing](https://github.com/Jorgemagic/CSharpDirectXRaytracing). The project structure is the same too, because i found it quite clean and easy to read.
