# [Nvidia] DXR "HelloTriangle" - Per Instance Data
This is the Raytracing triangle of Tutorial 2, that already use a perspective camera, with the addition of more geometry and so using "PerInstanceCommandBuffers" and "PerGeometryHitShader".

In this tutorial the rasterized version has been removed, and so you can't switch between the rasterized and the raytraced version, it render only the raytraced version.

This is a tutorial made by Nvidia, that you can find here: [Tutorial - Extras - Per Instance Data](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/raytracing/dxr/DX12-Raytracing-tutorial/Extra/dxr_tutorial_extra_per_instance_data).

Huge thanks to [Martin-Karl Lefran√ßois](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/author/mlefrancois/) and [Pascal Gautron](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/author/pgautron/) that made this tutorial, all this work is theirs.
