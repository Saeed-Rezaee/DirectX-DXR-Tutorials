# Primitives Rendering
This tutorial shows how to create a Raytracing Acceleration Structure from vertex and index geometry buffers.

This is an example i found from Jorge Cant√≥n, that you can find here: [Jorgemagic/CSharpDirectXRaytracing](https://github.com/Jorgemagic/CSharpDirectXRaytracing). The project structure is the same too, because i found it quite clean and easy to read.

## Points of interest
See the [Important Concepts](CONCEPTS.md) document, that you can find in this folder.
